# venus-signalk

A [SignalK Node Server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node) plugin. To
receive [Venus OS]()-style D-Bus signals to go into Signal K.

## How to run in SignalK Node Server

Ofcourse, read the signalk docs is what should be done. But for the impatient souls
like me a short instruction to get up & running:

- Install nodejs. Version 6 or newer.
- Clone signalk node server.
- Go into the dir and run `npm install`. This will install all dependencies in a
  subdir names `node_modules`
- Then run `npm install mpvader/venus-signalk`. This install this repo in to the
  same `node_modules` dir.
- Then go back to the root of signalk node server, and start it:

```
$ ./bin/signalk-server
signalk-server running at 0.0.0.0:3000

... etcetera
```

- Open a browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1/ to get to its config.

And then there is plenty more, see signalk docs for that.

## Test harness

To see data, without having actual Victron or other Venus compatible hardware setup,
get and run below explained Dummy data script. Or, clone
[dbus-recorder](https://github.com/victronenergy/dbus-recorder) and run play.sh.

Note that using the test harness will cause for some errors during init, as it
doesn't support doing a GetValue on the root item (/). See
https://github.com/mpvader/venus-signalk/issues/8 for details. For testing, there
errors are harmless.

## How to develop outside of Signal K

First run `npm install`.

Use ./demo.sh to run the code with full debug logging and the produced delta
serialised to stdout.

When not tested on an actual Venus device, there will be no output since there
is no data coming in. Use a dummy data script to test / develop on a pc:

dbus-listener.py is an example of how similar data would be read in Python. It
is not required to use the plugin.
